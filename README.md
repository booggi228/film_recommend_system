# Content-Based Film Recommend System: Project Overview
  * I've created a [film recommend system](https://film-recommend-system.ew.r.appspot.com/) for my own purposes as I'm a huge movie fan.  
  * Scraped over 25000 movies from 1990 to 2019 with IMDB rating above 5 from IMDB website using python and beautifullsoup. Here is a [link](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-scrape-multiple-pages-of-a-website-using-a-python-web-scraper-4e2c641cff8) to scraper I used with some additional changes I made.  
  * After cleaning the data and removing duplicates there are a bit over 9000 films to work with.  
  * The details of the movies are: movie title, genre, runtime, IMDB rating, total votes, cast names, film overview.  
  * Built flask web application and deploy it on google cloud platform.    
  * **Packages I used:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, flask, pickle, gunicorn.
